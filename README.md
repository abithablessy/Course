# Course
This commit contains list of courses display screen with the functionalities.
Now, i'm working on search and filter functionality.
In this commit i didn't fetch result's from api instead i saved those data in a variable and processed.Because i'm repeatedly getting 'Cross-origin' issue to access the data from server.I tried to use ajax cross origin plugin to resolve the issue it's resolved but there is some request limitation for that plugin, so i removed that.
I'm trying to get that fix from front end side, is there any help would get from server side that will help.
Please check the workflow, once i complete the other items will upload in the next commit.
